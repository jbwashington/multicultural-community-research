  "body": "### What is This?\r\nThis research consists of comprehensive survey of all boards, commissions and committees in the Northwest Arkansas area, identifying those that are interesting in diversifying their membership. Data consists of interviews of key leaders in the nonprofit sector, the municipal governments and the immigrant community. The impetus for this project is to create a pipeline of leadership opportunities for immigrant residents, as a way of amplifying their position and voice in the community. Increased civic participation by immigrants promotes stronger connection to the community, creating bridging social capital. The data collected during this project will be used to bolster the work of EngageNWA Immigrants from Abroad Pillar, a coalition of over 60 organizations working in unity on retraining and recruiting diverse talent to NWA.\r\n\r\n### Why Tho?\r\nAs a new immigrant destination in the US, Northwest Arkansas has seen an explosive growth in immigrants over the last two decades. In 1990, the foreign-born population was 1.9% of the total population. That number grew to 11.25% by 2014, prompting educational, health, financial and workplace organizations in the region to expand their reach to this newly diverse population. Despite the growing service ecosystem and relatively welcoming atmosphere, immigrants in NWA face a series of obstacles to integration. A key factor in integrating immigrants into new destinations is fostering collaboration across sectors in the community to work intentionally toward creating an environment in which all members can thrive, regardless of their ethnicity. These collaborative efforts require a knowledge base that informs the work. This research will create an opportunity for students to contribute knowledge to an active coalition in Northwest Arkansas that is focused exclusively on integrating immigrants in the region. \r\n\r\n### Contents\r\n- Audio recordings\r\n- Quantatative and Qualitative Data (tsv/csv)\r\n\r\n### TODO:\r\n- code data\r\n- transcribe interviews\r\n- data visualization\r\n",
